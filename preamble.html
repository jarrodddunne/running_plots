    <h1>Half Marathon Training Progression</h1>
    <p>This document shows the progression of various statistics over time, for training runs I did in preparation for a half marathon. The runs are loosely categorized as follows:</p>
    <h2>Runs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Zone 2</b>: Keeping heartrate at Zone 2 (&le;130bm for me according to my activity tracker) for 30-60 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Interval</b>: Alternating between slow (5mph) and fast (9mph) speeds, switching every 1min, for 20 minutes. Each run would increase the slow and fast speeds by .1 mph.</li>
        <li><b>Long</b>: Run at a comfortable 'race' pace for between 6-17 miles. Generally increased mileage by 1 mile per week, but decreased in some cases depending on how I was feeling.</li>
        <li><b>Negative Split</b>: Five miles, starting at 5mph, increasing speed by .5mph each mile. Each week increases the starting mph by .2 mph.</li>
        <li><b>5k</b>: Run a 5k as fast as I can. Generally, I set an intended completion time, and aimed to decrease that by a minute or so each successive week.</li>
    </ul>
